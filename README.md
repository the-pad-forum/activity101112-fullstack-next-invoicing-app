## Overview

This Next.js fullstack project is designed for students with prior experience in key web development concepts. It assumes familiarity with React components, hooks, data fetching among many others. The project builds upon these foundational skills, encouraging students to apply their knowledge in a more comprehensive Next.js fullstack environment.

## Objective

The objective is to empower students to consolidate their previous learning experiences into a fullstack Next.js project. This includes setting up your local development environment and integrating various technologies you've learned. The project focuses on practical application, guiding you to develop a complex web application using Next.js. Should you encounter any gaps in your knowledge, the project provides access to prerequisite materials, ensuring you can refresh or update your understanding as needed to successfully complete the project.

## Testing Challenges

Each challenge category focuses on a different aspect of fullstack development, ensuring a well-rounded assessment of your skills and knowledge as you progress through the Next.js Fullstack Project.

1. **Basic Understanding (30%)**
   
   - **React and JavaScript Knowledge**: Test your grasp of React fundamentals, including understanding of components, props, state, hooks, and newer features like Server Components and Suspense. This will ensure you can effectively utilize React within the Next.js framework.
   
   - **Project Setup**: Assess your ability to set up the project environment. Additionally, verify your capability to use GitHub and Vercel accounts for project deployment.

2. **TypeScript/JavaScript (30%)**
   
   - **Data Handling and Mutation**: Challenge you on mutating data using React Server Actions, and understanding how to revalidate the Next.js cache.
   
   - **Error Handling**: Include tests for handling general and '404' not found errors in JavaScript.
   
   - **Form Validation**: Test your ability to perform server-side form validation using JavaScript or TypeScript.

3. **UI/UX (30%)**
   
   - **Styling**: Evaluate your skills in applying different styling techniques in Next.js applications, including auto detecting os-level default colour theme setting, the use of `globals.css`, CSS Modules, TailwindCSS and DaisyUI.
   
   - **Optimization Techniques**: Test your ability to optimize images, links, and fonts for enhanced user experience.
   
   - **Search and Pagination**: Assess your ability to implement search and pagination features in a user-friendly manner.
